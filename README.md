**Project 1** 
This is a first project of Internship, a part of the Data Science course. Data provided to us for this project to work on related to 'Bi-cycle Ridings'.
The purpose of this project for us is to have a better & clear understanding mainly on Data Acquisition & Data Wrangling. This two heads cover various activities & different ways to perform those activities.
Project is performed in **'Next Hike_Project 1.ipynb'**__ file uploaded in the repository along with the **'Next Hikes_Project 1' PPT Presentation**__ & Output file **'Final_Dataset' in excel**__.

The contents of the project is as shown in following screenshot:
1. **Importing Liabraries:** Liabraries that are used in project are as mentioned below-
   - Pandas 
   - Numpy
   - Seaborn
   - Matplotlib
   - 
2. **Data Acquisition:** Three Datasets are loaded in the project .ipynb file - Dataset_1 *(csv format)*, Dataset_2 *(xlsx format)* & Dataset_3 *(csv format)*.
   
3. **Data Wrangling:** Various activities are covered under Data Wrangling along with the methods that are used to perform those activities, such as:
   - Merge Dataset:  .merge() method & .concat() method
   - Identifying Unique Values: .unique() method, .drop_duplicates(), .nunique() method & .value_counts method
   - Drop Unnecessary Columns: .drop() & del statement
   - Check the dimensions of the datasets: .shape function
   - Check data types of the datasets: Finding Data types of individual & multiple columns , Getting dataset by including or excluding datatypes & Conversion of Data types
   - Working of Central Tendency - Finding Mean, Mode & Median of Datasets
   - Treating Missing values
   - Outliers & Treatment to outliers
   - Skewness of Data
   - Correlation of Data

  4. **Box Plot** is used in 'Next Hike_Project 1.ipynb' file

  5. Output file 'Final_Dataset' is in excel format loaded in this repositary

Datasources used for project = Lecture recordings, Reference file that we received through emails & Google search 

-- Project Status: [Completed]
